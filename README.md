The versatility of Python :snake: enlightened by Torch :flashlight: to seize Deep Learning

In this initial phase I'm going to outline the tutorial structure.
I will definitely take inspiration from my [Torch Video Tutorials](https://github.com/Atcold/torch-Video-Tutorials), but I want to improve the content based on your suggestions.
Please, provide your contribution in the [wiki](https://github.com/Atcold/pyTorch-Video-Tutorials/wiki).
I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
